The Climate crisis is the real and the biggest issue which is further causing other crises. Even though India is the second-largest producer of coal, India faced a coal shortage. The recent crisis of coal caused disruption in power generation in many states like Bihar, Jharkhand, Punjab etc. and they faced power cuts or blackouts due to the shortage in coal production and power generation. On October 14, the lowest ever reserve of four days was left in the power plants in years.


Position of other countries in the crisis:

1. Recently, the temperature of the European Union reduced too much that increased the demand for gas for which coal was required and therefore international prices of coal increased.
